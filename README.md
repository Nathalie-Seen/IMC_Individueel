# IMC_Individueel 2.3
# This project is for IMC and was an individual task
# The basis is used was the initialisation and activation of the touchpad
#
# This project is about Billy!
# Billy is just a simple little face on a LCD.
# Billy can blink every 10 second no matter which emotion he has
#
# Billy has 4 different emotions
# Billy is at first just neutral with a little smile on his face
# When you press the play button on the touchpad, Billy becomes happy
# When you press the Set button, Billy becomes angry
# And when you press the Vol+ button, Billy becomes sad
# But dont you worry. Aftter around 25 seconds, Billy will forget what you pressed and return back to his neutral state.
